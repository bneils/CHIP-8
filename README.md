# CHIP-8
A chip8 interpreter in Rust I wrote. This uses SDL2 for graphics. 

You must look up how to install SDL2 for your OS. On Ubuntu the package is libsdl2-dev, which differs on other distros.

Windows requires you to download the binaries from the official SDL website, and copy them to a lib folder somewhere.
